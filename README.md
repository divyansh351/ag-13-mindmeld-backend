# AG-13 MindMeld Backend

This repository contains the backend codebase for the AG-13 MindMeld project. It is structured to support efficient development and maintenance, with features like controllers, middleware, models, and route handling.

## Folder Structure

- **controllers/**  
  Contains the logic for handling application requests. Controllers handle the business logic of the application, interact with models, and return responses.

- **middleware/**  
  Houses reusable middleware functions that operate on requests before they reach the controllers. This can include authentication, error handling, and logging middleware.

- **models/**  
  Contains the database models and schemas that define how data is structured and managed.

- **routes/**  
  Contains route definitions that map incoming requests to corresponding controllers and methods.

- **node_modules/**  
  Default folder for installed Node.js dependencies.

- **.env**  
  Environment configuration file. Stores environment variables like API keys, database connection strings, and other sensitive information. (Make sure to include `.env` in `.gitignore`.)

- **index.js**  
  The main entry point of the application. Initializes the server and sets up middleware, routes, and other configurations.

- **package.json**  
  Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and project settings.

- **package-lock.json**  
  Automatically generated file that records the exact versions of installed dependencies.

- **README.md**  
  This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **npm**: The package manager that comes with Node.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ag-13-mindmeld-backend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables. For example:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mindmeld
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. The server will run on the specified `PORT` in the `.env` file (default: 3000). Access the API at `http://localhost:<PORT>`.

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the application.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the application in development mode with hot reloading (if configured).
- `npm test`: Runs tests (if test scripts are defined).
